        <p>Hello and Welcome! My name is JoAnne Salmon, but you can call me Jo ðŸ˜Š I am an illustrator and animator with a love for all things creative. I have a background as an animator, storyboard artist and concept artist and have worked in the animation industry for many years. I am now embarking on new adventures.</p>
        <p>I create my artwork in various styles and techniques such as traditional and digital. I love painting with watercolour, acrylic gouache, and ink. I am always wanting to try new things and explore new works of art. I am based in the UK and all the art works are printed here. My landlordâ€™s cat Margo is the floor manager and makes sure everything is running smoothly and all is in excellent quality. Thank you for stopping by! Lots of Love! Jo and Margo.</p>
