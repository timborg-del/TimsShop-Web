Hereâ€™s a **README.md** template for your project. It includes instructions for setting up the project, installing dependencies (Vite and Node.js), and configuring the `.env` file with the PayPal Developer ID.

# Webshop

Welcome to **Webshop**! This is a [brief description of my project, e.g., "a web application built with React, Vite, and Node.js that integrates PayPal for payments"].

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apple-Bee/JoAnne-Web.git

cd JoAnne-Web
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`, including **Vite**.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholders with your actual values:

   ```plaintext
   # PayPal API Credentials
   # Obtain these from your PayPal Developer Dashboard: https://developer.paypal.com/
   VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id_here

   # API Base URL
   # Use http://localhost:3000 for local development
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - Replace `your_paypal_client_id_here` with your actual **PayPal Client ID** from the [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com/).
   - If you're using a different API base URL, update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` accordingly.

### 4. Run the Project

Start the development server using Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can view the project in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:5173
